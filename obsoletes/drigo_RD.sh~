#Goal: Create radial diffusivity maps from existing eigenvalues L1, L2, and L3.
#MAKE SURE you are in the present working directory and that L1, L2, and L3 are there as they will be used for dependencies.

#Dependencies:
#1. FSL and DTIFIT outputs L1, L2, L3
#2. fslmaths, part of FSL

for FILE in *L1*
